Cold and Dry, but I have my humidifier and it makes it right
Oh no the water of the humidifier ran out and now it doesn't work
I fixed it by adding more water and now it works perfectly again
Now the humidity has rised and I can breathe normally
Humidifiers are literally literally life changing, no kidding!
I will make sure that I always have one in my house
